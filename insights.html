    <p> Internal migration, both within a state and across states in India, improves households' socioeconomic status,
        and benefits both the region that people migrate to and where they migrate from. Remittances can help reduce
        poverty in the migrants' places of origin.<br>
        But scheduled castes (SC)--castes considered lower in the social hierarchy--and scheduled tribes (ST)--indigenous
        tribal populations--benefited less from migration as social discrimination continued to impact them in the
        places they migrated to, research shows.</p>

        <p>"This city was made of herds of castes. Even localities were identified by castes". Limbale is unable to
        secure a rental room unless he keeps his caste identity a secret, but that means living in fear of being
        exposed and facing violent consequences. Unable to transform his occupational mobility into social and
        geographic mobility, Limbale has no option but to live in a densely populated informal settlement with tenuous
        land rights and limited public services.</P>

    <p>Ethnographic work on rural-urban migrants from the state of Jharkhand finds that the decision to move to the
        city often includes an expectation of liberation from rigid caste structures in villages.  However, caste
        hierarchies and identities experienced by migrants do not disappear within cities, but are rather reorganized
        and reproduced as new collective identities emerge along reformulated caste lines, which are unique to the urban
        context.
        People belonging to scheduled casts or marginalized communities, do not only face problems
        due to their caste, but also due to their economic backgrounds. The above texts suggest that even if these people
        manage to break out of their brutal intersectionality by rising up the 'economic' ranks, they are still discriminated against
        due to their castes, that too by the ones belonging to upper castes. Hence, even though the country has progressed
        post globalization, it has not come out of its deep-rooted, discriminatory notions.
