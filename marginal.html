    <p>EPoD researchers took time series data from India’s National Sample Survey 1987 to 2011 and examined the different
        proportions of social groups among the poor.<br>
        -Among people living under the poverty line, the fraction of Hindu upper and middle castes
        (which includes groups known as “other backward classes” or OBCs2) decreased from about 50 to 40 percent –
        roughly a 10 percentage point decline.<br>
        -The proportion of the poor made up of Hindu lower castes (including scheduled castes and scheduled tribes)
        increased from about 33 to 40 percent.<br>
        -The proportion of the poor made up of Muslims increased from about 13 to 15 percent.
        <br><br><br></p>

<p>Here are two maps of India. the one on the right shows the concentration of rural population in parts of india including scheduled castes and
    tribes in 1991 (onset of globalization). As one can see, most of the concentration is in states like UP, Bihar and Jharkhand.
    When we look at the map given on the left hand side, we see that most no. of people that have migrated are the ones belonging to
            extremely densely populated states like UP and Bihar, Jharkhand etc. It is also important to note
            that metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru have the most amount of influx.  </p></div>

        <p> While for the "well-to-do's", or the 'haves', globalization enabled people to
        move to urbanized areas due to better opportunities. In case of the marginalised groups, many lost their jobs. This is because,
            post globalization, through economic reforms, govt. downsized many state enterprises and privatized many public
        sectors leading to loss of jobs for many marginalized groups that had reservations under a policy of affirmative
            action. People belonging to marginalized communities now had no choice but to migrate
            to a relatively more developed area. <br>

            Therefore, from the maps above, we cannot determine exactly how many marginalised people out of the total number
            have moved to these urban cities. But what definitely can be inferred is that while the effect of the situation
            remained the same for all communities, the cause greatly differs.
